This is the UI for the streamr demo.

This is a fork of the streamr network monorepo so it contains a stupid amount of unnecessry stuff. I have tried building just the client package but it failed and I lacked the bandwith to get to the bottom of it.

The important files are

network-monorepo/packages/client/examples/subscriber-ui.html
network-monorepo/packages/client/examples/publisher-ui.html
